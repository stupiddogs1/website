# ModbusTCPClient

### Introduction

ModbusTCPClient is a TCP Client for Modbus protocol. You can read/write coils and registers to devices or simulators that implemented Modbus TCP Server.

ModbusTCPClient supports all platforms that support .NET sockets.
ModbusTCPClient also has Playmaker actions integrated.
